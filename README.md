# file-management-script
This is a basic script that organizes files and group them based
on the file type and then stores all related file types in the 
folder.

# how it works
when the script is started, input the path to where you want to organize
files eg.(C:\Users\Info_Hunter\Desktop\test_files).
The script will automatically manage all the files in that folder for you 
and store them in their respective folders based on their file-types.

# supported file types.
As at now, it groups files based on the following, 
1. pdf files
2. docx files
3. pptx files
4. video files(.mp4 only)
5. image files(jpeg only)
6. An then all other files of file-types not listed above are stored in a folder called
   others
